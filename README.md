# Project 1

Have you ever wondered whether you were presenting your best and most positive face to the world? Evaluating your own appearance can be difficult, but more difficult is finding someone willing to give advice in this sensitive area, assuming you even want to hear such advice!

Baseline can help!  Submit a photo of yourself to the Baseline app, and it will be a truly dispassionate and perfectly consistent judge, returning scores from the Face++ API algorithms quantifying "emotion" and "beauty".  When submitting the photo you are asked for your current status in the job market, and any other comments you wish to include.  With this information, you can track whether you are getting better at presenting an attractive and cheerful face to the world. If you are satisfied with your appearance, Baseline's ongoing feedback can warn you that you're revealing more than you think.
